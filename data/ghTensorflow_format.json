This is especially useful when user has a use case to convert a remotely saved model.\r\n\r\nRegarding unit test: I didn't find corresponding unit test for this function in `segment_test.cc`. For this kind of functionality maybe an integration test is more suitable? Please let me know and I could work on that."
